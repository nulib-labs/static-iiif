// Publishing: the transform that turns a working IIIF document into its
// published twin, and the diff that decides what a run has to do.
//
// Pure — node:crypto only, no AWS SDK — so all of it is unit-testable. The IO
// lives in app/aws/lambdas/publish/.
//
// Publish is a rewrite, not a copy. Each space's documents describe their own
// URLs, so a published manifest is retrievable at its own `id`, and so is the
// working draft. The cost is that S3 ETags are useless for "has this changed?"
// — the bytes always differ — which is why we hash and record it ourselves.

// An absolute IRI for the same reason MANAGED_KEY is one: a compact IRI would
// need a prefix declared in @context, and an object in @context breaks Clover.

// sha256 of the exact bytes stored, never of a re-serialization. There is no
// canonical JSON here: applyCollections reorders keys as a side effect, so
// hashing a round trip would report changes that are not changes.

// A self-reference is any string starting with the space's base, at a path
// boundary. The boundary matters: a bare startsWith would also rewrite
// `…/working-notes/…`, which is the same class of bug as the index-name
// separator.

//
// That distinction is load-bearing. `Annotation.target` is a bare string
// (ui/src/lib/canvasAssets.js), so an id-key walker would leave every
// annotation pointing at a canvas URL that does not exist in the published
// space: blank canvases in Clover, and no error anywhere.
//
// What it must NOT touch:
//   - Image API service ids. IMAGE_API_BASE_URL is a CloudFront host, entirely
//     distinct from the S3 bucket origin, so they cannot match by construction.
//   - A third-party partOf kept as provenance — different host, same reason.
//   - @context. Safe today because the extension namespace is on a different
//     host, but a walker that rewrites arbitrary values is one namespace change
//     away from breaking compact-IRI expansion, so it is skipped explicitly.
