// Authorization model.
//
// Roles and per-collection grants are both Cognito Groups, so they arrive inside
// the ID token as the `cognito:groups` claim and the API authorizes with no
// extra lookup. Two role groups exist:
//
//   admin   — everything, including managing users
//   editor  — full control of works inside the collections granted to them
//
// A grant is a group named `collection:<slug>`. An editor holding
// `collection:eis` may edit, create, delete and re-file works in that
// collection, and nothing else.
//
// Reads are scoped the same way writes are: you see the collections you hold
// and the works inside them. Someone with no role and no grant sees nothing.
//
// A grant without the editor role is meaningful and read-only — it is how you
// give someone sight of a collection without letting them change it.
//
// IMPORTANT: this bounds what the DASHBOARD enumerates, not what exists. The
// IIIF bucket is world-readable by design (Clover fetches manifests
// unauthenticated), and the root collection is a public index of every
// collection and its members. Scoping these endpoints stops a signed-in user
// discovering the corpus through the app; it does not make any individual
// manifest secret.
//
// Pure — no AWS SDK, no I/O. Everything here is a function of the claims and the
// resource, so it is testable directly and cannot drift from what the API does.
