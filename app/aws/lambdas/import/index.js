// A Step Function rather than the self-invoke chain in importAssets.js because
// collections run to thousands of works: AGENTS.md already says that when

// (`CodeUri: ../`), and for store.js it is mandatory rather than convenient:
// that module is THE single manifest writer, and a private copy here is exactly
// how the search index once silently stopped tracking imported works.
