# Repository Guidelines

## Project Overview
This project generates static IIIF Image 3.0 API resources and IIIF Presentation 3.0 manifests for a collection of images, deployed entirely on AWS. A SAM application (`app/aws/template.yml`) provisions a source S3 bucket and an output S3 bucket (`*-iiif`). An S3-triggered Lambda (`app/aws/lambdas/iiif-image/`) converts uploaded source images to pyramid TIFFs (Level 2) for use by `samvera/serverless-iiif` (a nested SAR application). A second Lambda (`app/aws/lambdas/manifest/`) exposes a CRUD API (behind API Gateway + Cognito auth) for managing IIIF Presentation 3.0 manifests. A React/Vite frontend (`ui/`) talks to both, and is hosted via Amplify.

The project metadata CSV → manifest generation flow described in earlier iterations is still a future goal; today the manifest API supports single-manifest CRUD only.

## Project Structure
```
app/
  aws/
    template.yml          # SAM template — all infra (S3, Cognito, API Gateway, Lambdas, Amplify Hosting)
    samconfig.toml         # Your personal SAM deployment config (gitignored — copy from samconfig.toml.example)
    samconfig.toml.example
    lambdas/
      iiif-image/          # Lambda: converts source images to pyramid TIFFs (Level 2)
      manifest/            # Lambda: manifest CRUD API
  shared/
    manifest.js            # Manifest key/template helpers shared by the manifest Lambda
ui/                        # React/Vite frontend — talks to the deployed AWS stack
  .env.local               # Your personal env config (gitignored — copy from .env.local.example)
  .env.local.example
```

> Note: `app/storage/`, if present, is a vestige of an earlier approach and is not used by any current Lambda.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
- `npm install` — install root dependencies; run inside `ui/` and any Lambda subdirectory separately.
- `npm test` — placeholder; replace with your actual test runner as coverage is added.
- `cd app/aws && sam build --use-container && sam deploy --guided` — one-time build and deploy of your personal dev stack. Docker must be running; `--use-container` is required so SAM installs native dependencies (e.g. sharp) inside a Linux arm64 container matching the Lambda runtime. Requires `app/aws/samconfig.toml` (see Local Development below).
- `cd app/aws && sam sync --watch` — fast iterative redeploys of Lambda code changes to your personal stack (see Local Development).
- `cd ui && npm run dev` — start the Vite dev server for the frontend, pointed at your personal stack's endpoints via `ui/.env.local`.

## Local Development

Every developer deploys and works against their **own personal SAM stack** rather than a shared one — there is no local emulation of Cognito/S3/API Gateway. "Local" means: the UI dev server runs on your machine, talking to real AWS resources.

### Prerequisites
- Docker running (needed for `sam build --use-container`).
- Node/npm installed.
- An AWS SSO profile with access to the target account (ask a teammate which profile/account this project deploys to if you don't know — check `~/.aws/config` for candidates). This repo has been deployed under an `AWSAdministratorAccess`-type profile.

### 1. Authenticate to AWS
```
export AWS_PROFILE=<your-profile>   # e.g. staging-admin
aws sso login
aws sts get-caller-identity         # sanity check — should return your account/role, not an error
```
SSO sessions expire; re-run `aws sso login` whenever `sam`/`aws` commands start failing with `ExpiredToken`/`ExpiredTokenException`.

### 2. Stand up (or update) your personal stack
1. Copy `app/aws/samconfig.toml.example` to `app/aws/samconfig.toml` (gitignored) and set `stack_name` to something unique to you, e.g. `<yourname>-dev-static-iiif`.
2. First time only:
   ```
   cd app/aws
   sam build --use-container
   sam deploy --guided
   ```
   `--use-container` is required so SAM installs native dependencies (e.g. sharp) inside a Linux arm64 container matching the Lambda runtime. Answer the guided prompts once; SAM remembers them in `samconfig.toml` for next time.
3. On later changes: `sam build --use-container && sam deploy` (drop `--guided`). Add `--no-confirm-changeset` to skip the interactive `y/N` prompt if you've already reviewed the changeset shape.
4. For fast iteration on Lambda code without a full deploy, use `sam sync --watch` (or `sam sync --code` for a one-shot sync) instead.
   - **Caveat:** `IiifServer`, the nested `AWS::Serverless::Application` wrapping `samvera/serverless-iiif`, does not hot-sync via `sam sync --watch` the way the top-level `ManifestFunction`/`IIIFImageFunction` do. Changes affecting it need a full `sam deploy`. This is a third-party component that rarely changes, so it's a minor caveat in practice.

### 3. Create `ui/.env.local` from your stack's outputs
Fetch your stack's outputs:
```
aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name <your-stack-name> --query 'Stacks[0].Outputs'
```
Copy `ui/.env.local.example` to `ui/.env.local` (gitignored) and fill it in from the output values — the mapping from CloudFormation output key to `VITE_*` variable is documented in the example file itself (`IiifEndpoint` → `VITE_IIIF_BASE_URL`, `ManifestApiUrl` → `VITE_MANIFEST_API_URL` with `/manifests` appended, `IIIFBucketName` → `VITE_STORAGE_BUCKET`, etc).

### 4. Run the UI and sign in
```
cd ui
npm run dev
```
Open `http://localhost:5173`. You'll land on the Cognito `Authenticator` sign-in screen — this is expected, the whole app is behind auth now. If you don't have a user in your stack's Cognito pool yet, create one (the pool uses email as the username):
```
aws cognito-idp admin-create-user \
  --user-pool-id <VITE_COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID> \
  --username <your-email> \
  --user-attributes Name=email,Value=<your-email> Name=email_verified,Value=true \
  --message-action SUPPRESS

aws cognito-idp admin-set-user-password \
  --user-pool-id <VITE_COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID> \
  --username <your-email> \
  --password '<a-password-meeting-the-pool-policy>' \
  --permanent
```
(If `admin-create-user` says the user already exists, just run the `admin-set-user-password` step to reset it.) Sign in, and you should see the dashboard: the IIIF Image URL lookup, the S3 Storage Browser listing your stack's IIIF bucket, and the Presentation Manifests panel talking to the real manifest API.

## Environment / Feature Flags

### UI (`ui/`)
| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `VITE_IIIF_BASE_URL` | e.g. `https://abc.cloudfront.net/iiif/2` — serverless-iiif endpoint; pre-populates the URL input. Copy from the `IiifServer` nested stack's endpoint output after `sam deploy`. |
| `VITE_MANIFEST_API_URL` | The `ManifestHttpApi` endpoint from stack outputs. |
| `VITE_STORAGE_BUCKET` / `VITE_STORAGE_REGION` | The IIIF output S3 bucket and its region, for the Amplify Storage Browser. |
| `VITE_STORAGE_IDENTITY_POOL_ID` / `VITE_COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID` / `VITE_COGNITO_CLIENT_ID` | Cognito identifiers from stack outputs, for the Amplify `Authenticator`. |

### Amplify deployment
Connect the repo in Amplify (this is Amplify **Hosting** only — auth/storage/API are all defined via SAM, not the Amplify backend framework). The inline `BuildSpec` in `template.yml`'s `AmplifyApp` resource handles the build (`ui/` subdirectory, outputs `ui/dist`) and injects the `VITE_*` environment variables from the stack's own resources automatically.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
Use CommonJS modules (`require`/`module.exports`) and 2-space indentation in all Node.js code under `app/`. The UI (`/ui`) uses ESM and JSX. Prefer descriptive, dashed directory names and camelCase identifiers. Strings default to double quotes; async work uses `async`/`await`.

## Testing Guidelines
Add tests alongside code under `app/**/__tests__/` with filenames ending in `.test.js`. Use Node's native runner (`node --test`); wire it into `npm test` once implemented. Keep fixtures small under `app/<module>/__fixtures__`. Any new tiling or presentation feature should include at least a smoke test and validation against a sample IIIF document.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
Use Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, etc.) from the start. Reference related GitHub issues in the PR body. Include manual verification steps (`npm test`, sample render) so reviewers can reproduce. Keep PRs focused; split unrelated work into separate branches.
